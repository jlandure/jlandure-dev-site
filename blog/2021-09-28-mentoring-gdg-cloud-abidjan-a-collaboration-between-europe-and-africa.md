# Mentoring GDG Cloud Abidjan — a collaboration between Europe and Africa

For one year now, [Julien Landuré](https://twitter.com/jlandure) — a Cloud GDE, GDG Cloud Nantes leader and DevFest organizer — has been mentoring the GDG Cloud in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. He says it’s not simply about exchanging tech knowledge, but also about making various resources (such as blog posts, online talks, or videos) available in a language they all understand and use on a day-to-day basis — French. He’s very proud of this on-going, fruitful collaboration with a group of tech-savvy, eager to learn individuals. Let’s get to know Julien and see what’s the story behind his collaboration with GDG Abidjan in his own words:

# 💡 It all started with a GDG

My story began in 2011 — along with two very good friends, [Benjamin Petetot](https://twitter.com/bpetetot) and [Jean-François Garreau](https://twitter.com/jefbinomed), we’ve decided to look around for more people interested in sharing advanced tech knowledge in our city — Nantes. At that point, we didn’t know that such a group could be called a community.

In January 2011 we created a non-profit organization called “GTUG Nantes”. We had Cyril Mottier, a popular Android GDE join us for our first meetup in April 2011\. Since nothing ever dies on the Internet, you can still encounter [our announcement](https://sites.google.com/a/gtugs.org/nantes/news/sortiededeveloppezpourandroiddecyrilmottieretludovicperrier) (in 🇫🇷) drifting the cyberspace since 2011! Brings back some great memories.

This was a year of great breakthroughs. We’ve also decided to go to Google I/O on our own. It was very inspiring and we set our objective to create a mini Google I/O in Nantes.

In 2012, we rebranded and officially became GDG Nantes. Program leads proposed we could organize an even bigger event called DevFest sometime between October and November. It took us 2 months to organize everything, but all in all we were able to host a multi track conference for about 200 attendees.

Not bad for the first time, huh? And we’re still growing, gathering each autumn to celebrate technology, share advanced knowledge and build a stronger, more diverse developers’ community. DevFest in Nantes is now one of the biggest events of this kind in the world. Just check out the [2021 edition](https://devfest.gdgnantes.com/)!

# ☁️ Learning all about Cloud

Nowadays I work within GDG Nantes with a dedicated Cloud group called [GDG Cloud Nantes](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-cloud-nantes/). The main purpose is to share knowledge about Cloud technologies with a strong focus on Google Cloud. I’ve also got speakers to cover topics regarding Azure or AWS to keep our minds open and stay up to date. The Cloud landscape is evolving quickly as we’re observing the rise of serverless, containerization, Kubernetes etc. We feel it’s important to get updates on the new features and products and be aware of how the market changes.

In December 2019, [GDG Cloud Abidjan](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-cloud-abidjan/) asked me (via [Ezekias Bokove](https://twitter.com/EzekiasBokove), GDG Organizer) to help them bring knowledge to their community and create a sort of mentoring. They were looking specifically for a person who could provide all the info and participate in events in their native language, which is French. I was really happy to join!

First contact with Ezekias

I’ve talked to Ezekias and we both decided to spread the word about our events and amplify our communication to make it grow so that more people could learn about Google Cloud updates and best practices.

We started sharing some information about the events. At the beginning of each meetup, I have a slide on GDG Cloud Abidjan to show our partnership. I’ve also talked to another GDG organizer from Abidjan, [Louis Japheth Kouassi.](https://twitter.com/LKeenDev)

As a GDE, I’ve done two talks about managed services, [AppEngine](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-cloud-abidjan-presents-appengine-le-serverless-au-service-des-developpeurs/) and [Cloud Run](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-cloud-abidjan-presents-decouvrir-les-cloud-events-avec-cloud-run-cloud-run-week/) to help the Abidjan community. The first one was actually recorded and is available on [GDG Abidjan YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLRHlF8K5ok) for everyone interested in the topic!

I’ve also done many introductions to French speakers and GDEs to support them. Together, we co-organized ~12 talks for 500 attendees, our events were held mainly in French.

# 📣 The Cloud Run Week

We went even further and decided to co-organize a big event together: The Cloud Run Week, during which we had 5 talks in 5 days. It was almost as famous as Fashion Week. 😉

We were focusing on talks about Cloud Run related to different subjects: new features, security, event driven development (Cloud events), server-side streaming. During this intense week of learning the talks were held in both French and English.

During the [Cloud Run Week](https://twitter.com/gdgnantes/status/1370037011533414404), we had a pleasure to host many top speakers, including GDEs and Googlers:

*   Monday: [Wietse Venema](https://twitter.com/wietsevenema) (GDE, author of the Cloud Run book) in French and English
*   Tuesday: [Guillaume Blaquiere](https://twitter.com/gblaquiere) (GDE) in French
*   Wednesday: [Marton Kodok](https://twitter.com/MartonKodok) (GDE) in English
*   Thursday: [Eric Briand](https://twitter.com/eric_briand) (GDE) and [myself](https://twitter.com/jlandure) (GDE) in French
*   Friday: [Valentin Deleplace](https://twitter.com/val_deleplace) (Dev Advocate Google) in French

The Cloud Run Week program!

[GDG Cloud Abidjan](https://twitter.com/GDGCloudAbidjan) was the main host for the talks on Monday, Tuesday and Friday while GDG Cloud Nantes took over for the talks on Wednesday and Thursday. We recorded everything to allow us to share it on our channels. The recordings are available on GDG France YouTube channel ([dedicated playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri1CRMl4oDo&list=PLuZ_sYdawLiUDaVVgUlZtTkGGqf7WzDvM)). There were over 150 participants who joined us during the live broadcasting of this special week.

# 🚀 From Nantes to Abidjan… and back

I’ve also asked Ezekiel and Louis from GDG Abidjan to share a few words about our ongoing cooperation — what did they enjoy about it? Did it bring their community closer together? Do they wish to keep on working together in the future? Here’s what they said:

> Working with GDG Nantes allowed me to feel the team spirit, collaborate and share knowledge, opinions, and even improve my interpersonal skills. Thanks to working with a team, I’m no longer stuck with one idea; I gained a new perspective and became more creative. Networking is great because it allows us to meet expert-level speakers from different places and work environments.
> 
> We really appreciate the collaboration with GDG Nantes. They are always ready to send us their speakers when we need one, which is great. We hope that this collaboration can grow over time.
> 
> — [Louis Japheth Kouassi](https://twitter.com/LKeenDev)
> 
> After the creation of GDG Cloud Abidjan, we decided to get closer to an existing GDG Cloud in order to learn from their experience. This is where our collaboration with the GDG Cloud Nantes was born. Thanks to our collaboration, we have organized about ten events and impacted more than 300 people despite the pandemic outbreak. What we like the most in this collaboration is the fact of learning, sharing and exchanging knowledge with people who have different perspectives.
> 
> Our collaboration is great and we will continue to work with the GDG Cloud Nantes for our future activities.

Overall, what was most important for me was the opportunity to make the Google Developers communities even more inclusive and diverse. It was also a great example of a cross-border corporation of curious and open-minded individuals sharing a passion for technology. I’m really glad GDG Abidjan reached out to me — I’m hoping to keep on sharing my knowledge with them in the future. It’s been a great adventure so far, and it’s still so much to discover together!

Note: a big thanks to my reviewers at Zenika and also at Google. 💚

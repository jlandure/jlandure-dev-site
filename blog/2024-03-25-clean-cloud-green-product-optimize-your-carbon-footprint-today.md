# Clean Cloud, Green Product: optimize your carbon footprint today

In our connected world, sustainability has become a critical concern.  
As we rely more and more on technology, the ‚Äúeverything is software‚Äù approach comes with a hidden cost: the environmental impact of our digital activities.

The Tech ecosystem where ‚Äúeverything is software‚Äù has some responsibility : we have to reduce our carbon footprint for our customers.

Let‚Äôs go deeper into the concept of digital carbon footprint and cloud carbon footprint.

## Digital Carbon Footprint

From a Product Management perspective, the amount of data your product generates and transfers can significantly impact your customers‚Äô digital carbon footprints.

> Every year, something between 3ZB to 40 ZB of data is transferred and transported online.

## How to optimize your Digital Carbon Footprint?**

*   Optimize images and videos for the web üëâ reduce file size
*   Compress everything üëâ enable gzip/brotli
*   Leverage web caching üëâ configure http headers
*   Reduce data usage üëâ minimize http requests
*   Improve latency with CDNs üëâ store your content in geographically distributed servers using Content Delivery Network tools

## Cloud Carbon Footprint

Many organizations are now cloud first companies and use cloud solutions to host and operate their products.

> Although data centers represent a relatively minor part of carbon emissions in digital activities, they can become a significant weight on the carbon footprint of companies.

## How to optimize your Cloud Carbon Footprint?**

*   Choose the right data centers location üëâ with the [Google Cloud region picker](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/region-picker/))
*   Match the appropriate cloud service model üëâ based on your needs between IaaS, CaaS, PaaS, FaaS [(more in my article in french here)](/zenika/pizza-as-a-service-les-differents-modeles-du-cloud-b18ffaa6906c)
*   Rightsize your resources üëâ remove any unused or underutilized resources
*   Batch workloads strategically üëâ you may schedule batch workloads for times when there is lower [carbon intensity](https://learn.greensoftware.foundation/carbon-awareness/)
*   Adopt and implement FinOps principles üëâ optimize cloud costs and minimize energy consumption. [(more info in my presentation here)](https://speakerdeck.com/jlandure/introduction-au-finops-avec-google-cloud-cloud-alpes)
*   Train your team üëâ I recommend the [LFC131 ‚Äî Green Software for Practitioners](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/)

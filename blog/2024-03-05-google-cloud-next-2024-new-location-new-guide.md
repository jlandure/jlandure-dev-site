# Google Cloud Next 2024: new location, new guide

I had the opportunity to travel to San Francisco many times for Google I/O or Google Cloud Next. This year, Google Cloud Next will take place at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas, offering a fresh location and exciting new discoveries.

Google Cloud announced it with [the use of the Sphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxN05oZOu3I) in Las Vegas displaying a “gcloud sphere unlock” command. 🎁 Fun fact: this command was not just a visual element, but it actually functioned and provided attendees with a temporary 50% discount voucher for Google Cloud Next.

*   💧 No need to bring your own refillable water bottle. Google used to give one bottle to each attendee when you take your badge.

*   📝 Create a note by session to write down the impactful message of the speaker.
*   🛜 Feel free to sum up ideas on your favorite social media channel to grow your personal branding. Do not forget to mention the speaker(s).

*   ⚡️ ProTips: Keep time to rest to energize your body.

If you are an introvert, it is very important because you will stay near hundreds of people around you.  
If you are not a native english speaker, speaking to others will take you some energy.

*   ⚡️ ProTips: Take advantage of quiet time to charge your mobile. 🔋

## Around the event

*   🎙️ You should create some content to share what you learn at Google Cloud Next: it could be article, podcast, videos (shorts!) or even talks. Several “Next Recap” events will be done by the community or by partners: you should submit a proposal.
*   🌆Las Vegas is quite a big city. You have to make sure you are in a safe place. I used to get my hotel at a maximum of 10 min walk from the venue in the city center. Doing so avoids me having to order an Uber each time I want to travel.
*   🍸 Remember to check the partner parties around the conference with this great website : [many parties were listed in 2023  
    ](https://conferenceparties.com/next23/)The official Google-organized Next Party will be held on Wednesday, April 10th. The question remains: which big names will perform at the concert?
*   ⚡️ ProTips: Check if your mobile provider works in the USA and add an offline area of Las Vegas in Google Maps. 📲

# ‚è± 3 minutes to deploy your static Nuxt.js app on AppEngine

[#webdev](/t/webdev) [#googlecloud](/t/googlecloud) [#serverless](/t/serverless) [#vue](/t/vue)

I‚Äôve been deploying applications on [serverless solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing) since 2010\. Recently, I discovered [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and I wanted to create this post on how to quickly set up a static Nuxt.js app on [AppEngine, the Google Cloud PaaS](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

# [](#getting-started-with-nuxtjs)üìù Getting started with Nuxt.js

[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) is described as

> The Intuitive Vue Framework  
> Build your next Vue.js application with confidence using NuxtJS.  
> An open source framework making web development simple and powerful.

It's very powerful! You can use it to create various architectures: [SSR](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#server-rendered-universal-ssr-), [SPA](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#single-page-applications-spa-) or [Static](https://nuxtjs.org/guide#static-generated-pre-rendering-) renderings.  
For this demo, we will be focused on the **static feature** using the `nuxt generate` command.

## [](#%E2%9A%97-create-the-project)‚öó Create the project

For the demo, we will use a fresh new project. To do this, execute the `npx create-nuxt-app` command to create a [simple Nuxt.js application](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/installation#using-code-create-nuxt-app-code-).  

    $ node -v
    v12.16.3

    $ npx create-nuxt-app

## [](#test-locally)‚úÖ Test locally

As described in the command line, run the `npm run start` [script to get your app running](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/commands#development-environment) on `http://localhost:3000/`.

Let's edit the `index.vue` and write this html:  

    <h2 class="subtitle">Hello Nuxt on AppEngine üéâ</h2>

And it works! Very easy to see our modification instantly.

## [](#%F0%9F%8F%97-build-it)üèó Build it

To [build the app statically](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/commands#static-generated-deployment-pre-rendered-), run the `npm run generate` command:  

    $ npm run generate

‚ú® Congratulations, we built our first Nuxt.js application!

_ProTips: We can check the files in the `dist` folder or run it with `npx http-server dist`._

# [](#deploy-it-on-appengine)‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy it on AppEngine

Then, to share the project with the rest of the world, we can deploy it on AppEngine. [Appengine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) comes with a lot of features and quotas.

It is free for a basic usage thanks to its quotas BUT we have to enable billing to enjoy it. As a new customer, we get [$300 to spend on Google Cloud Platform products](https://cloud.google.com/free) during your free trial.

## [](#create-a-project)üõí Create a project

Go to [`console.cloud.google.com`](//console.cloud.google.com) and [create a new Google Cloud Platform project](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/building-app/creating-gcp-project).  
Please save the [PROJECT_ID] of the project: you have to replace the `nuxt-static-deploy` with your [PROJECT_ID] for the rest of the post.

_ProTips: we can retrieve the [PROJECT_ID] in the url of the web console like `https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/start?project=nuxt-static-deploy` where nuxt-static-deploy is my [PROJECT_ID]._

_ProTips: To create a project to host your app, we can also use the `gcloud projects create` command. we need to enter a [PROJECT_ID], `nuxt-static-deploy` for example._  

    # Create a project 
    $ gcloud projects create nuxt-static-deploy

    $ gcloud --project nuxt-static-deploy services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com

## [](#write-the-descriptor-raw-appyaml-endraw-)‚úèÔ∏è Write the descriptor `app.yaml`

AppEngine supports various programming languages: python, go, java, php, nodejs etc.  
To deploy static files, the best practice is to use the `python37` runtime.

Let's create a file in `.appengine/app.yaml`  

    runtime: python37

    handlers:
    - url: /
      static_files: index.html
      upload: index.html
      secure: always
    - url: /(.*)
      static_files: \1
      upload: (.*)
      secure: always

For more information on the descriptor file, [please read this doc](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/config/appref).

Don't forget to copy the file in our `dist` folder using this command `cp .appengine/app.yaml dist/`.

_ProTips: We can add it to the `build` script in your `package.json` file._

## [](#deploy-your-app)üöÄ Deploy your app

If this is the first you are using the Google Cloud Platform, you have to install the `gcloud` command line utility following [the official page](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts) or [using Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/google-cloud-sdk).

Deploy our app using the `gcloud app deploy` command:  

    $ gcloud app deploy --project nuxt-static-deploy dist 

    You are creating an app for project nuxt-static-deploy.

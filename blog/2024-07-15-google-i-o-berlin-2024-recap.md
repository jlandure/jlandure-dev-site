This year’s I/O Berlin highlighted the importance of Europe’s vibrant developer scene. With over 16 million developers in the region, Google is fostering a supportive environment for them. The event itself hosted over 1300 attendees from 100 countries, showcasing the global reach of the European developer community. Last year, it was in Amsterdam and I enjoyed a lot to attend the event:

## Gemini all the things!

Google’s mission has always been to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible. Now, they’re applying that same philosophy to artificial intelligence. The new tagline, “make generative AI accessible to every developer on the planet,” sets the stage for a future where AI tools are available for everyone. The keynote focused on 3 different areas : Innovation, Productivity and Responsibility.

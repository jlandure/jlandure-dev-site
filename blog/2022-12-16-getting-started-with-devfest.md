# Getting Started with DevFest

During the last Google Dev Summit France, I got many questions on how to start a DevFest and on how to create a successful event like [DevFest Nantes](https://devfest.gdgnantes.com/). The first goal of this article is to show that organizing a beautiful DevFest is not something impossible. The second goal is to give some tips through my own experience.

Let’s do a quick introduction to DevFest and the first steps to be successful organizing a community-driven event.

# Background

Hey 👋 I’m [Julien](https://jlandure.dev/) and I co-created the [GDG Nantes](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-nantes/) back in January 2011\. GDG Nantes had the chance to go to [Google I/O](https://google.com/io/) in 2011 and in 2012\. It was awesome! A mix of great talks, demos, networking, codelabs and afterparty! Such a good moment! 💚

From our organizer perpective, we were so enthusiastic that we were willing to create a mini Google I/O in our city “Nantes”, in our country “France” 🇫🇷.

💡 In September 2012, The GDG Program proposes that GDGs could organize a DevFest “Developer Festival” to create a multi-track 4h-long conference. We jumped in and today, [DevFest Nantes](https://devfest.gdgnantes.com/) is 10 years old and we will be back in October 2023 for 2 days with more than 2500+ attendees per day.

# What is DevFest?

[DevFest](https://developers.google.com/community/devfest) is a trademark. [GDGs](https://developers.google.com/community/gdg) around the world can use this name to create a conference. The main advantage to be called DevFest is to get supported by the Google DevRel program:

*   📖 useful guidelines from the [community](https://gdg.community.dev/)
*   💸 a first sponsorship package (from Google itself 😁) and some swag
*   ⚙️ a tool to find speakers (Googlers and [GDEs](https://developers.google.com/community/experts))
*   🎨 great materials to do the design and the communication.

⚡️ To organize a DevFest, you have to think about 4️⃣ aspects to deliver the best experience : Attendee, Sponsor, Speaker and Organizer.

# First steps

> “Start small, think big. Don’t worry about too many things at once” — Steve Jobs

👐 However, it’s not easy to start from scratch to create a community event. To begin, we started creating a “not so big” event with a target of 150 attendees the first year in 2012.

🏫 To begin, we tried to find a free location. To achieve that, we made a partnership with a school. We get a super feeling with [Epitech Nantes](https://www.epitech.eu/fr/ecole-informatique-nantes/) and we did the first two editions of DevFest Nantes overthere. We grew from 150 to 250 attendees.

💸 To keep our budget low, we didn’t offer any swags for the first editions. [The first website was designed using Google Sites](http://devfest2012.gdgnantes.com/) (no-code before it exists 😁).

🎟 We created tickets at the price of 10€ _(paid event to avoid no-show)_ and we created [our sponsorship offers](https://be498903-a-78651552-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/gdgnantes.com/devfest2012/sponsors/Dossier_partenariat.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqYDsMSAK0q4Vy_35zFnct_wR0DFxV2CBgxCtqSBlIM8pAMpxS0omR9Sma59_DGQeq50IUN94jcQbcDjjl08ZYswSAOczs22jzHjA3YL6b3MSJcVnT3HhCzmYiqBojIX-hSTLZQRn_ChzJB0Pbt93wyyYhy0HTErrPpk4yvjq2XBccsFp0Wh4Z5dedFfGsU3pzXTJpzF7i3dXd2jDV6N0k42Xyl6tAbl2PZG8cx1L5uN9Bbk88%3D&attredirects=0) at the price of 500€ and 1000€. At this time, sponsorship was about 75% of our revenue and tickets 25%.

We also started with strong principles:

*   🎙 Find awesome speakers with a mix of local, national and international speakers
*   ⚡️ Create a multi-track conference to be more inclusive and present “discovery” talks (non-tech topics but related to the tech ecosystem like Agile, Management, Diversity)
*   🍽 Deliver a delicious meal at lunch

💪 The first run was not easy but we get sold-out just 2 days before the events and get some press releases about our events.

# Scaling

> Scaling before you are ready means you will scale any existing problems in your business! — Lor Bradley

The first two editions were successful. We got some problems but that’s how you grow up!

😎 The very good idea was to stay in a one-day conference format and keep looking at a location where the event can scale in terms of:

*   Speaker experience: great venue with awesome rooms
*   Sponsor experience: capacity to host more sponsors and booths
*   Attendee experience: a location near the train in the city center
*   Organizer experience: a place where we can rent partially and grow with the DevFest Nantes journey.

🏡 We find the perfect place for us : “La Cité Nantes Congress Centre”

🚀 Important things also about our event, it is the fact that it is recurring that gain visibility and attractivity. People get to heard about it, to love the experience we deliver and share it to others!

# Tips & Tooling

# Conclusion

🏔 Organizing a DevFest is a journey. You have to dedicate your time and energy but it also opens new opportunities in terms of upkilling, networking, sharing and accomplishments!

😊 Personally, I use to say that I organize DevFest Nantes because I wish I could attend such an event in my own town to learn when I was a student!
